This Roguelike is a hobby and expression of my love of all things Roguelike. It is a loose port of my tabletop game of the same name and will include many of the same creatures, weapons and items. 

For the graphics renderer, I am using Bearlibterm, which can be found here: http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal. I would like to express my happiness that it exists.

Other than that, I have used nothing else to create this game, other than my own skills. (Visual studio doesn't count!) 

Other than that, this game comes 'as is'. There's no guarantee that this will be finished, but I'll give it my best shot! 


Thank you for reading this and taking interest in my little game.
